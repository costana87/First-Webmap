Lab3 First Webmap
This project is a map of the running route that I take when I go out to exercise. The actual length of the route is 1.1 miles from start to finish. The path mainly follows along the side of 321. Within the map there are a few points of interest that are marked. These spots are not really marked as stopping points but theyre just marked because they are some of my favorite plasces to eat. On these markers you can see the name of the location when putting your sursor over it. 

### DATA
The data that was used in the map was sourced from a few websites. By using google maps, I was able to get my path created as well as get the distance information. I then used Maps to GPX to convert the file and then converted it once agian in geojson to get the correct format to use.
